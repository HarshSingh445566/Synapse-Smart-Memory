About the Project

Synapse – Smart Memory System is an AI-powered personal knowledge storage and retrieval web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The project allows users to save, organize, and intelligently search through their personal notes and visual content. It integrates OpenAI embeddings to enable semantic (meaning-based) search, and uses Tesseract.js for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), allowing users to upload images and automatically extract text and tags from them.

The system automatically generates tags for every note or image based on detected objects and keywords, improving discoverability. It includes an advanced search system that supports both keyword-based and semantic searches, enabling users to find relevant notes even when exact words don’t match. Additionally, the application provides smart filters to filter notes by date and tag, along with a simple analytics dashboard that displays insights such as the total number of notes, notes created during the current month, and the most frequently used tags.

The frontend, developed in React.js, provides an intuitive and responsive interface, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, manages data storage and AI-based processing through MongoDB and OpenAI APIs. The inclusion of OCR-based image extraction makes it easy to capture and store information from photos, posters, or documents.

Overall, Synapse acts as a digital “second brain,” combining text, image, and AI to help users remember, organize, and retrieve information efficiently — a smart and seamless way to store knowledge for personal or professional use.
